<p>Bookmarks; improved.</p>
<p>I often find myself bookmarking articles to read later, only for them to be lost in the <em>endless void</em> that is the typical browser’s bookmark system. The default bookmark systems of web browsers can quickly get crowded and inefficient. Furthermore, they are often covered up by layers of proprietary code, which can make it difficult to extend the systems in ways that are more in line with your workflow.</p>
<p>Enter hypermark.</p>
<p>Features: - hypermark is transparent and extensible through its use of plain markdown files, which allows users to easily write custom content management systems. - hypermark persistently stores the paths to these markdown files, called <strong>hyperpaths</strong> in a simple, editable text file. - hypermark relies on simple data structures called <strong>bytemarks</strong> which are written to files as markdown tables. - Easily move, duplicate, delete and create bytemarks through hypermark’s TUI. - Send bytemarks between different hyperpaths. - Save articles from the front page of Hacker News to read later. - Save arbitrary URLs as bytemarks. - TUI and CLI options.</p>
<p>Features to be added: - YouTube integration: Reduce your dependence on YouTube’s algorithms.</p>
